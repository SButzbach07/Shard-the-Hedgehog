== Folder sprites/overrides/ ==

Sprites defined in this folder override sprites defined elsewhere.

If you want to modify a sprite that is shipped with Open Surge, do not modify
its .spr file directly. If you do so, you'll lose your changes as soon as you
upgrade the engine. Instead, copy the file you want to modify into this folder
and modify YOUR COPY instead. Files stored in this folder won't be overwritten
when upgrading the engine.

When modifying a sprite, do not edit the original image files that are shipped
with Open Surge. Instead, make a copy and edit YOUR COPY. This helps you keep
your changes if you upgrade the engine.
